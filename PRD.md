# PDF-A-go-slim — Product Requirements Document

## Overview

A browser-based PDF optimization tool that reduces file size without requiring server-side processing. Runs entirely in the browser using JavaScript/WebAssembly. No uploads, no accounts, no file size limits beyond available RAM.

## Origin Story

This project grew out of [PDF-A-go-go](https://github.com/khawkins98/PDF-A-go-go), an embeddable PDF viewer for the web. While building a 3-page showcase PDF for the project's demo page, we hit a problem that turns out to be universal:

A clean 32KB PDF generated by ReportLab was opened in Adobe Illustrator for a small layout tweak. Illustrator saved it back at 198KB — a 6x increase for a cosmetic change. What happened? Illustrator silently embedded full TrueType copies of Helvetica and Courier (standard fonts every PDF reader already has), added a 10KB JPEG thumbnail nobody asked for, injected layers of AI-private metadata, and duplicated font references in multiple formats.

We tried the obvious tools:
- **Ghostscript** got it to 96KB but couldn't strip the redundant standard font embeddings
- **qpdf** barely moved the needle (194KB) — it optimizes structure but doesn't touch content
- **iLovePDF** (online) got it to 62KB — good result, but you're uploading your file to a third-party server and paying for batch use
- **Smallpdf** — paywalled before you can even try

This is a solved problem in theory — every optimization technique is well-documented — but there's no tool that puts them all together in the browser where your files stay private and the tool is free.

## The Problem

PDF bloat is everywhere and nobody has a good answer:

- **Creative tools are the worst offenders.** Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Canva, and Google Slides all embed unnecessary fonts, duplicate objects, and inject application-private metadata. A simple "Save As PDF" routinely doubles or triples the file size.
- **Desktop software** (Adobe Acrobat, Ghostscript) can fix this but isn't always installed. Ghostscript is powerful but CLI-only and its flags are arcane (`-dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4`).
- **Online services** (iLovePDF, Smallpdf) work but require uploading your files to a third party. They're paywalled for batch or large files. For institutional users with sensitive documents, uploading isn't an option.
- **Command-line tools** (qpdf, mutool) need installation and only handle structural optimization, not content-level cleanup like font deduplication or image recompression.

There's no open-source, privacy-first, in-browser option that handles the full range of optimizations.

## Core Value Proposition

- **No upload** — files never leave the browser
- **No install** — works in any modern browser tab
- **Free and open source** — MIT licensed
- **Batch capable** — drag in multiple PDFs, optimize all at once

## Target Users

1. **Content publishers** — bloggers, documentation writers who need lean PDFs for the web
2. **Developers** — embedding PDFs in apps, need to minimize transfer size
3. **Institutional users** — universities, governments with privacy-sensitive documents they can't upload to third-party services

## Technical Architecture

### Core Engine (as built)

```
src/
  main.js                     # UI, drag-and-drop, worker orchestration
  worker.js                   # Web Worker — off-main-thread processing
  engine/
    pipeline.js               # Sequential optimization passes with progress + options
    optimize/
      streams.js              # Recompress streams with fflate level 9
      images.js               # FlateDecode → JPEG recompression (lossy, opt-in)
      font-unembed.js         # Remove embedded base-14 standard fonts
      font-subset.js          # Subset embedded fonts via harfbuzzjs WASM
      dedup.js                # Hash-based object deduplication (djb2)
      fonts.js                # Consolidate duplicate embedded fonts
      metadata.js             # Strip XMP, Illustrator, Photoshop bloat keys
      unreferenced.js         # Remove unreachable objects via BFS traversal
    utils/
      accessibility-detect.js # PDF/A, PDF/UA, tagged PDF detection + accessibility audits
      hash.js                 # Shared hashing (hashBytes) + font constants (FONT_FILE_KEYS)
      stream-decode.js        # Decoders: Flate, LZW, ASCII85, ASCIIHex, RunLength, PNG prediction
      pdf-traversal.js        # BFS graph walker from PDF trailer
      content-stream-parser.js # Extract char codes per font from content streams
      unicode-mapper.js       # Map char codes → Unicode codepoints
      glyph-list.js           # Adobe Glyph List + standard encoding tables
      harfbuzz-subsetter.js   # harfbuzzjs WASM wrapper for font subsetting
```

### Options Schema

All passes receive an `options` object. Each pass checks its own flags and ignores unknown options, making the schema forward-compatible with presets and per-pass configurability.

```js
{
  lossy: false,                  // Master switch for lossy optimizations (default off)
  imageQuality: 0.85,            // JPEG quality 0-1 (only when lossy=true)
  maxImageDpi: undefined,        // Downsample images above this DPI (only when lossy=true)
  unembedStandardFonts: true,    // Remove embedded base-14 fonts (default on, lossless)
  subsetFonts: true,             // Subset embedded fonts to used glyphs (default on, lossless)
}
```

### Key Technical Decisions

**PDF Parsing**: [pdf-lib](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib) for low-level PDF object access (PDFDocument, PDFDict, PDFArray, PDFRawStream, etc.). Provides cross-reference tables, object streams, and incremental updates. We operate directly on its internal context objects for optimization.

**Stream Compression**: [fflate](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate) — pure-JS zlib for deflateSync/inflateSync. Faster and smaller than pako. Used for both stream recompression and PNG prediction reversal.

**Image Recompression**: [jpeg-js](https://github.com/jpeg-js/jpeg-js) — pure JS JPEG encoder/decoder (~15KB). Works in both Web Worker and Node (for tests). Chosen over OffscreenCanvas because OffscreenCanvas isn't available in Node test environments.

**Font Unembedding**: Type1 and TrueType only. Type0/CIDFont composites use 2-byte Identity-H encoding — unembedding would require rewriting content stream text operators, which is too risky. Fonts with custom `/Encoding << /Differences [...] >>` are also skipped.

**Font Subsetting**: [harfbuzzjs](https://github.com/nicbou/harfbuzzjs) WASM (~596 KB gzipped) for TrueType/OpenType subsetting. We call the C API directly (`hb_subset_or_fail`) rather than using the JS wrapper (which has CJS/ESM interop issues — see `docs/learnings.md`). Supports Type1/TrueType (simple, 1-byte char codes via Encoding/Differences → Adobe Glyph List) and Type0/Identity-H (2-byte CIDs via ToUnicode CMap, with `retain-gids` to preserve CID=GID mapping). WASM is lazy-loaded as a separate Vite chunk.

**Future considerations for image processing**: OffscreenCanvas + Canvas API could enable WebP encoding (`canvas.toBlob('image/webp', quality)`) in browsers that support it.

**WASM Option**: For maximum compression, compile [QPDF](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf) (Apache 2.0) to WASM. MuPDF and Ghostscript are AGPL — licensing concerns for bundling. Ship as an optional heavy module (~5MB).

### Browser Constraints

| Constraint | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| **Memory** | Process pages/objects incrementally via streaming; don't load entire PDF into memory at once for large files |
| **No filesystem** | Use File API for input, Blob URLs for output, IndexedDB for temp storage during batch operations |
| **Single thread** | Offload compression to Web Workers; use `SharedArrayBuffer` where available for zero-copy transfer |
| **No native zlib** | pako is ~95% as fast as native zlib; CompressionStream API (Chrome 80+) is native-speed alternative |

### Node.js Mode

The same core engine runs in Node.js with:
- `fs` instead of File API for I/O
- Native `zlib` instead of pako
- Optional native font tools (harfbuzz) for faster subsetting

Publish as:
```
npm install pdf-a-go-slim       # Core engine (browser + Node)
npx pdf-a-go-slim ./input.pdf   # CLI usage
```

## UI Design

Platinum-inspired floating palette desktop — five always-visible palettes (Settings, Results, Inspector, Preview, Accessibility) over a persistent drop zone, borrowing structural patterns from Mac OS 8 (beveled title bars, WindowShade collapse, warm cream surfaces, dense layouts). See `docs/UI.md` for detailed design decisions.

### Design Philosophy

Three principles guide visual decisions:

1. **Structure over skin.** The Mac OS 8 reference is chosen for its spatial model (floating palettes, persistent tool windows, information always on screen) rather than for decoration. If a Platinum convention makes the tool harder to use, it gets dropped.
2. **Utility, not decoration.** Every visual element — striped title bars, sunken panels, beveled borders — is borrowed because it communicates hierarchy or state, not because it looks retro.
3. **Modern underneath.** System fonts, CSS custom properties, semantic HTML, responsive layout. The aesthetic is a styling layer; the app works without it.

The hypothesis behind the design: late-90s desktop paradigms (persistent tool palettes, dense information display, always-visible controls) may be a better fit for single-purpose browser utilities than the modern convention of progressive disclosure and minimal surfaces. Browser tools are used in focused bursts, not browsed casually — the same use pattern that floating palettes were designed for.

This exploration may become a published essay.

### Layout

Single-page app framed as a desktop utility window:

- **Title bar** — App name left-aligned, compact
- **Content area** — Three mutually exclusive states:
  1. **Idle** — Sunken drop zone panel + toolbar-style preset buttons + advanced settings group box
  2. **Processing** — File list with progress bars (taller, sunken track, solid fill)
  3. **Results** — Dense result panels with beveled borders, disclosure sections, download buttons
- **Status bar** — Bottom bar with sunken fields: state text (left), file/preset info (right)

### Controls

- **Presets**: Toolbar-style raised buttons — "Lossless" (default), "Web", "Print"
- **Mode toggle**: Lossless vs Lossy, compact inline toggle
- **Lossy settings** (expandable): Image quality slider, max DPI input
- **Advanced** (expandable): Fieldset-style group box with individual toggles
- **Batch actions**: "Download All" (individual sequential downloads)

### Responsive

Works on mobile for quick single-file optimization. Window chrome stacks/shrinks gracefully. Batch features are desktop-focused.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Average lossless reduction | 20-40% on typical PDFs |
| Processing speed (10MB PDF) | < 5 seconds in browser |
| Bundle size (core) | < 200KB gzipped |
| Bundle size (with WASM) | < 5MB |
| Browser support | Chrome 80+, Firefox 90+, Safari 15+, Edge 80+ |

## Accessibility & PDF/A Considerations

PDF optimization can degrade accessibility. The following mitigations are in place and planned:

### Already addressed

- **ToUnicode CMap preservation** — `font-unembed.js` preserves `/ToUnicode` entries when replacing standard font dicts, so screen readers retain glyph-to-character mapping.
- **Document language migration** — `metadata.js` extracts `dc:language` from XMP and sets `/Lang` on the catalog before stripping XMP, preserving the language tag for assistive technology.
- **Dedup safety** — `dedup.js` only deduplicates `PDFRawStream` objects. Structure tree elements (`/StructElem`) are plain `PDFDict` objects and are never merged.
- **Tagged PDF detection** — `accessibility-detect.js` detects `/MarkInfo` and `/StructTreeRoot` on the catalog. Traits are reported in `stats.pdfTraits` for UI visibility.
- **PDF/A awareness** — Pipeline auto-detects PDF/A conformance level (via XMP `pdfaid:part`) and disables font unembedding and XMP stripping for PDF/A files. Bloat keys are still stripped.
- **Structure tree protection** — Confirmed via tests that `unreferenced.js` BFS traversal reaches `/StructTreeRoot` and its descendants through the catalog. Tagged structure is never removed as orphaned.
- **XMP accessibility metadata** — `parseConformanceFromXmp()` detects `pdfuaid:part` (PDF/UA) and `pdfaid:part`/`pdfaid:conformance` (PDF/A). XMP is preserved for PDF/A files.
- **Accessible PDF test suite** — Test fixtures for tagged PDFs, PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-2b, PDF/UA, and tagged PDFs with orphans. End-to-end pipeline tests verify accessibility data survives optimization.
- **PDF/A-1 object stream protection** — Pipeline conditionally disables `useObjectStreams` when `pdfALevel` starts with `1`, preserving strict PDF/A-1 conformance. PDF/A-2+ files still use object streams for better compression.
- **PDF/UA font protection** — Font unembedding is blocked for PDF/UA documents (`isPdfUA` triggers skip), matching the PDF/A behavior. Ensures all fonts remain embedded as required by ISO 14289.

### Accessibility palette (implemented)

A dedicated Accessibility floating palette surfaces accessibility information after optimization:

- **Trait checklist** — pass/fail rows for Tagged PDF, Structure Tree, Document Title, Display Title, Document Language, PDF/A, PDF/UA. Uses existing `stats.pdfTraits`. Additional checks (title, displayDocTitle, markedStatus) inspired by [PDFcheck](https://github.com/jsnmrs/pdfcheck) by Jason Morris.
- **Lightweight audits** — three `<details>` sections: ToUnicode CMap coverage (text extractability), image alt text coverage (Figure StructElems with `/Alt`), structure tree depth/types. Runs on the optimized document via `auditAccessibility()` in `accessibility-detect.js`.
- **External validator links** — Download: veraPDF (PDF/A), PAC (PDF/UA). Online: PDFcheck, PDFix, axes4, PAVE. Shown after optimization completes.

### Future work

| Item | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Per-page accessibility drill-down** | P3 | Expand the Accessibility palette to show per-page structure tree and alt text coverage for large documents. |

## Learnings & Documentation

Technical learnings, design decisions, and pitfalls encountered during development are captured in [`docs/learnings.md`](docs/learnings.md). This is a living document — update it whenever we discover something non-obvious about PDF internals, tooling trade-offs, or browser constraints.

## Open Questions

1. ~~**pdf-lib vs custom parser?**~~ **Resolved:** pdf-lib works well. Direct access to its internal `context` and indirect object enumeration provides sufficient low-level control for all current optimization passes without needing a fork.
2. **WASM Ghostscript licensing**: Ghostscript is AGPL. MuPDF is also AGPL. Best alternative: compile [QPDF](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf) (Apache 2.0) to WASM for structural optimizations that pure JS can't handle.
3. ~~**Standard font unembedding safety**~~ **Resolved:** Implemented for Type1/TrueType only, skipping Type0 composites and fonts with custom Differences encodings. Enabled by default (`unembedStandardFonts: true`) since all conforming PDF readers are required to provide the base-14 fonts.
4. ~~**Configurability UX**~~ **Resolved:** Implemented preset buttons (Lossless/Web/Print), collapsible Advanced Settings panel with lossy/lossless toggle, image quality slider, and font unembedding checkbox. Presets set all controls; manual tweaks auto-detect matching preset or show "Custom". Options flow through to the worker and engine unchanged.
